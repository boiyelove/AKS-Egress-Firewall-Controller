# AKS-Egress-Firewall-Controller

Make every AKS outbound path explicit, inspected, observable, and testable.

## Problem statement

A workload egress intent is validated and converted into a deterministic route and allow-list plan for AKS, UDR, and Firewall Premium adapters.

A production implementation can still fail even when every resource deploys successfully. The material risk is a cluster that appears healthy while administration, workload identity, tenant isolation, recovery, scaling, or egress differs from the reviewed design. The design therefore treats AKS, Firewall Premium, UDR, and the surrounding identity and evidence controls as one reviewable system rather than unrelated configuration tasks.

## Example case study

### Situation

A regulated payments cluster must prove where containers connect on the internet. This controller centralizes outbound routing and domain policy so individual namespaces cannot silently bypass inspection.

### Response

A payments namespace declares the exact vendor endpoints it needs. The controller converts that intent into reviewed routes and firewall rules, rejects a wildcard proposed during troubleshooting, and preserves workload-to-destination evidence for the assessor.

The team first exercises the repository's synthetic approved and denied fixtures. An approved request must produce the same idempotent plan on replay; a stale, unscoped, public, or unapproved request must fail before an Azure adapter is allowed to run.

### Expected outcome

Stakeholders receive a decision package they can attach to a change record: requested scope, controls evaluated, the reason for approval or denial, and the explicit handoff to live integration. The example supports design review and incident rehearsal without pretending that a local test changed Azure.

## Architecture

A private AKS subnet uses UDR through Firewall Premium; DNS proxy, application rules, FQDN tags, threat intelligence, and optional NAT provide controlled egress. A policy controller validates that workloads declare approved destinations.

Primary services: `AKS`, `Firewall Premium`, `UDR`, `NAT Gateway`, `Azure Monitor`.

This repository implements the first production-oriented vertical slice: a
fail-closed, adapter-neutral control plane that validates tenant scope,
freshness, approvals, secretless identity, private access, and the exact
project action before producing a deterministic execution plan. Azure adapters
consume that plan; they are deliberately outside the local simulator so local
tests cannot claim a live cloud change occurred.

The upper boundary names the principal services and technologies used by this repository. The lower boundary shows the implemented control flow: desired state is validated, provider action remains an explicit integration gate, and sanitized evidence is retained for review and deterministic replay.

## Best complementary diagram

**Recommended view: Workload egress packet-path topology.** A topology view is the strongest complement because it makes network and identity boundaries, enforcement hops, and the governed path physically legible.

The view follows **Pod initiates connection → Apply namespace policy → Inspect through firewall → Reach approved destination**. Use it during design reviews, operational walkthroughs, and failure-mode discussions; use the logical architecture above when the question is which technologies integrate.

## Quickstart

Requirements: Python 3.11+ and Git. No Azure credentials are required.

```bash
./scripts/validate.sh
python3 src/control_plane.py --request examples/approved-request.json
```

The command emits canonical JSON with a stable idempotency key. The denied
fixture exits with status 2 and explains the failed invariants.

## Security boundaries

- Managed identity or workload identity only; embedded credentials are denied.
- Public network access and stale evidence are denied.
- Production and break-glass targets require explicit approval.
- The IaC entry point is opt-in and defaults to deploying nothing.
- Evidence output contains identifiers and decisions, never credential values.

## Verification and limitations

Local validation covers 13 tests, deterministic replay, JSON parsing, Python
compilation, ignore hygiene, and Bicep compilation when a compiler is present.
It does **not** prove Azure deployment, service licensing, quota, data-plane
permissions, provider/API availability, cloud failover, load, cost, or teardown.
See [`docs/test-matrix.md`](docs/test-matrix.md) and [`docs/runbook.md`](docs/runbook.md) before any integration trial.

## Infrastructure inputs

Resource behavior and deploy-time values are intentionally separated:

- [Bicep template](infra/main.bicep) — Azure resources, modules, and security controls.
- [Bicep parameters](infra/main.bicepparam) — environment-specific names, regions, identities, and feature inputs.

Start with the parameter file's safe values, replace synthetic identifiers, and run an Azure what-if before deployment.
